# Gumloop Unified Model Context Protocol (guMCP)

guMCP is an open-source collection of Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers that can be run both remotely and locally. The project aims to create the largest collection of MCP servers with a unified backend, fostering a community around AI integrations and the future of AGI.

## Overview

While many MCP server providers are closed source, and open-source alternatives typically only support local hosting through stdio, guMCP provides:

- A comprehensive collection of MCP servers that work both locally and remotely
- Support for both stdio and SSE (Server-Sent Events) transports
- A unified backend architecture for consistent implementation
- Full open-source access to encourage community contributions

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11
- Git
- For Windows users: A bash-compatible shell is recommended (Git Bash, WSL, etc.)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/gumloop/guMCP.git
   cd guMCP
   ```

2. **Set up a virtual environment**:

   This isolates the project dependencies from your system Python installation.

   ```bash
   # Create the virtual environment
   python -m venv venv
   
   # Activate it (choose the appropriate command for your OS)
   # On Unix/macOS:
   source venv/bin/activate
   
   # On Windows (Command Prompt):
   venv\Scripts\activate
   
   # On Windows (PowerShell):
   .\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
   
   # On Windows (Git Bash):
   source venv/Scripts/activate
   ```
   
   You'll know your virtual environment is active when you see `(venv)` at the beginning of your command prompt.

3. **Install dependencies**:

   ```bash
   # Install core dependencies
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   
   # Install development dependencies (for contributing)
   pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
   ```

4. **Configure environment variables**:

   ```bash
   # Create a local environment file from the template
   cp .env.example .env
   
   # Open the .env file in your preferred text editor and update values as needed
   # If you're using VS Code:
   code .env
   ```
   
   The `.env` file contains configuration for:
   - API keys for service integrations
   - Authentication settings
   - Server configuration options
   - Development environment settings


## Usage

### Running SSE Servers

An SSE server can be run locally. This will provide a single URL and host every server available.

To start the SSE development server, run:

```bash
./start_sse_dev_server.sh
```

For convenience, we also provide a lightweight MCP Client to connect to SSE servers. Usage:

```bash
python tests/clients/RemoteMCPTestClient.py --endpoint=http://localhost:8000/simple-tools-server/local
```

### Running Stdio Servers

```bash
python src/servers/local.py --server=simple-tools-server
```

For convenience, we also provide a lightweight MCP Client to start and connect to stdio servers. Usage:

```bash
 python tests/clients/LocalMCPTestClient.py --server=simple-tools-server
```

## Supported Servers and Authentication Methods

The following table provides an overview of the current servers implemented in guMCP, their authentication requirements, and relative ease of use with different authentication methods:

| Server | Auth Type | Remote Auth<br>(e.g., Cursor) | Local Auth<br>(e.g., Claude Desktop) | Documentation |
|--------|-----------|-------------------------------|--------------------------------------|---------------|
